## [§0] Streaming Live RAG

Real-Time Incremental Retrieval, Multi-Intent Decomposition, and State-Preserving Answer Refinement

## [§1] Executive Summary & Problem Overview

Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems operate in a static, batch-oriented turn cycle: a user finishes speaking or typing, submits a query, and waits while the system searches a knowledge base, synthesizes an answer, and responds.

In conversational voice systems and real-time support scenarios, this paradigm introduces unacceptable conversational latency and fails to reflect natural human communication:

- **High Conversational Latency:** Waiting for the user to complete a multi-sentence utterance before initiating search forces pauses of several seconds.
- **Compound / Multi-Intent Requests:** Real user utterances often package multiple implied needs into a single stream of speech (e.g., asking about room capacity, cancellation terms, and catering options together).
- **Late-Arriving Constraints:** Users naturally introduce clarifications or additional constraints mid-conversation (e.g., *"Actually, the trip was international"*). Traditional systems discard prior context or restart the pipeline from scratch rather than performing incremental refinement.

### [§1.1] The Target Challenge

The objective is to design and build an event-driven **Streaming Live RAG Engine** that:

1. **Listens Incrementally:** Processes timestamped transcript chunks in real time, predicting retrieval intent before the user finishes speaking.
2. **Decomposes Multi-Intent Queries:** Identifies and parallelizes retrieval for multiple discrete sub-questions embedded within a single utterance.
3. **Refines Rather Than Restarts:** Selectively updates answers and citation graphs when late constraints arrive, preserving session state.
4. **Guarantees Corpus Grounding:** Enforces strict provenance and citation checks, returning explicit uncertainty indicators when evidence is insufficient.

### [§2.1] Core Pipeline Components

| Component | Functional Responsibilities | Core Engineering Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieval Controller | Evaluates incoming transcript fragments to decide when to retrieve, when to wait for semantic stabilization, and when to suppress search entirely (e.g., conversational formatting). | Balancing early retrieval latency gains against premature, noisy searches triggered by incomplete thoughts. |
| 2. Multi-Intent Decomposition | Parses compound, unsegmented utterances into discrete, search-ready sub-queries. | Extracting distinct orthogonal questions without losing conversational context or over-fragmenting search. |
| 3. Evidence Fusion & Reranking | Collects candidate chunks across all sub-queries, reconciles redundant evidence, and ranks snippets for maximum relevance and factual density. | Merging multi-source evidence without diluting context windows or introducing contradictory facts. |
| 4. Session-Only Refinement | Applies late-arriving constraints (e.g., date adjustments, exceptions) directly onto existing answer states without clearing session context. | Tracking answer versions and mutating only affected claims rather than re-running full-corpus retrieval. |
| 5. Observability Telemetry | Emits real-time event logs capturing timestamps, retrieval decisions, source mappings, version transitions, and token costs. | Maintaining clean, structured telemetry under sub-second streaming constraints. |

## [§3] Hard Engineering Rules & Constraints

To ensure rigorous benchmarking and evaluate algorithmic quality, the system must adhere to strict constraints:

- **Corpus Isolation:** All retrieved evidence must derive exclusively from the provided corpus. No external web scraping, third-party knowledge bases, or unindexed parametric model memory may be used to answer factual claims.
- **No Hardcoding / No Precomputation:** The benchmark replay evaluation is held-out and private. Prompts, queries, and canned responses must not be embedded in application code.
- **Rigorous Factual Grounding:** Every factual assertion must be attributed to verifiable corpus chunk IDs or section markers (`[Doc_ID §Section]`). If the corpus lacks sufficient evidence to answer any sub-intent, the system must explicitly emit an uncertainty indicator or request targeted clarification.
- **Session-Bound State:** Cross-session profiling and persistent user tracking across independent test runs are prohibited. Memory is strictly ephemeral and scoped to the active conversation session.
- **Architectural Parsimony:** Multi-agent frameworks or complex orchestration pipelines are evaluated on cost-to-performance efficiency. Every added component must justify its latency and compute overhead.

## [§4] Input & Output Event Specifications

The following scenarios demonstrate expected system behaviors across incremental streaming, late-detail refinement, and query suppression.

### [§4.1] Example 1: Incremental Multi-Intent Utterance

A user speaks a complex, multi-part request. The system begins retrieval speculatively before the user finishes speaking, decomposes intents, and aggregates findings into a single grounded answer.

#### [§4.1.1] Stream Processing Timeline

| Timestamp | Incoming Transcript Chunk | Controller Decision & System Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 s | *"I need to plan a customer workshop in…"* | **Wait.** Intent is incomplete and semantically unstable. No retrieval. |
| 0.8 s | *“…Pune for 30 people, and I need…”* | **Provisional Retrieve.** Stable geographic and capacity entities identified. Issue early search for `"Pune workshop venue capacity 30"`. Log `retrieval_started`. |
| 1.6 s | *“…the cancellation policy and the catering options.”* | **Decompose & Parallel Retrieve.** Deconstruct into three sub-queries: (1) venue capacity, (2) cancellation terms, and (3) catering options. Dispatch parallel searches and rerank candidate chunks. |
| 2.1 s | `[Utterance End]` | **Synthesize.** Stream single unified response addressing all three sub-intents with citations, noting any unverified aspects. |

#### [§4.1.2] Structured Output Event Record

```
{
  "retrieval_events": [
    { "timestamp_s": 0.8, "query": "Pune workshop venue capacity 30", "trigger": "provisional" },
    { "timestamp_s": 1.6, "query": "cancellation policy workshop venues Pune", "trigger": "multi_intent" },
    { "timestamp_s": 1.6, "query": "catering service options workshop Pune", "trigger": "multi_intent" }
  ],
  "sub_queries": [
    "venue capacity for 30 attendees in Pune",
    "cancellation terms and refund policies",
    "on-site and external catering options"
  ],
  "answer": "For a 30-person workshop in Pune, documented options include Venue A and Venue B. Venue A provide
  "citations": [
    "Doc_12 §2",
    "Doc_31 §4",
    "Doc_09 §1"
  ],
  "uncertainty": "Catering accommodation policies for Venue A could not be verified from the retrieved corpus.
}
```

### [§4.2] Example 2: Late-Arriving Detail (Refine, Do Not Restart)

A user introduces a constraint after receiving an initial answer. The system must update the answer version in-place, preserving established facts while querying only for the delta.

| Interaction Step | User Utterance | Expected System Behavior & Response State |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1: Initial Request | *"Summarize the travel reimbursement rule for an employee trip."* | Retrieves base policy guidelines. Emits cited summary. Stores evidence context and Answer Version 1 in session memory. |
| Step 2: Late Detail | *"The trip was international and the booking was made after travel."* | **Does not restart session.** Recognizes modification to existing topic. Dispatches targeted queries for *international travel* and *post-travel booking exceptions*. |
| Step 3: Refined Response | *(Generated Output)* | *"The standard reimbursement rule still applies. However, the late-booking exception requires senior director approval, and international travel introduces a mandatory foreign currency receipt verification requirement."* *(Preserves prior citations, adds delta citations, increments to Answer Version 2).* |

### [§4.3] Example 3: Query Suppression (No Retrieval Required)

The system detects requests that modify formatting, style, or summarization of previously generated context, suppressing unneeded corpus queries.

| User Input | Controller Evaluation | Expected Assistant Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| *"Please repeat your last answer in two bullets."* | `retrieval_required: false` `reason: presentation_restructure` | Transforms existing session context into two concise bullet points. No vector search or corpus queries executed. Retains prior citations without fabricating new ones. |

## [§5] Technical Evaluation Gates

Systems are evaluated against six automated and quantitative acceptance gates:

| Gate | Criterion | Target Threshold | Validation Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Reproducibility | Pass / Fail | Container launches via a single command on a clean machine; automated replay suite completes without manual intervention. |
| G2 | Early Retrieval | >= 80% of eligible queries | Retrieval commences prior to final transcript completion on held-out streaming prompts, maintaining low false-trigger rates on no-retrieval cases. |
| G3 | Multi-Intent Identification | >= 70% of compound queries | Accurately identifies and isolates at least two distinct sub-intents in compound test utterances. |
| G4 | Factual Grounding | >= 85% citation support | All sampled factual assertions are supported by cited corpus chunks; zero fabricated or hallucinated document IDs. |
| G5 | Session Refinement | Verified state continuity | Late-arriving constraints narrow or update existing responses without clearing session state or re-executing full-corpus search. |
| G6 | Telemetry & Observability | 100% trace coverage | Structured logs or metrics dashboards capture execution timestamps, retrieval triggers, citations, answer version lineage, and token cost. |

## [§6] Common Technical Pitfalls

1. **Eager / Premature Retrieval on Noise:** Triggering vector search on every incremental token causes system thrashing, high compute costs, and noisy context windows. The controller must wait for semantic intent boundaries.
2. **Context Loss on Late Constraints:** Resetting the conversation state when a user introduces a clarification discards valuable retrieved context, doubling latency and causing disjointed replies.
3. **Citation Hallucination:** Generating fabricated citations (`[Doc_999]`) or citing chunks that do not explicitly contain the stated facts fails automated grounding gates.
4. **Ignoring Presentation-Only Turns:** Querying the vector database when the user simply asks to reformat, shorten, or translate prior output wastes tokens and risks introducing drift.
5. **Over-Fragmenting Sub-Queries:** Splitting a single simple question into multiple near-identical queries pollutes the reranker and exhausts token limits.
